about
-----

The purpose of CiteBox is to provide an easy way for
library users to simply paste citations that they have
and, using Brown Universities FreeCite API (http://freecite.library.brown.edu/),
parse their citation and redirect them to there
libraries link resolver

usage
-----
CiteBox is designed to be easily added to any website. The only dependency is JQuery

All that is necessary is to include the following:

  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://<citeboxhost>/css/citebox.css"></link>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="http://<citeboxhost>/citebox/<citeboxhost>/<baseLinkResolverURL"></script>  

Replacing '<citeboxhost>' with the host name of where-ever citebox is running
and '<baseLinkResolverURL>' with the base URL of your link resolver.

Then call: 
  CiteBox.attach($(<myElement>));
where '<myElement>' is what ever element you want CiteBox to live in.

You can easily customize the default styling of CiteBox by simply
replacing the link to 'citebox.css' with your own custom css
